# Valentine Captcha

A playful "captcha" puzzle that leads to a **Will you be my valentine?** screen.

## How it works

1. **Captcha screen** – "Verify you're human" by dragging and dropping scrambled photo tiles to restore the image. Tiles swap positions when dropped on each other.
2. **Valentine screen** – After solving the puzzle and clicking Verify, the screen asks "Will you be my valentine?" with **Yes!** and **No** buttons. The No button runs away every time you try to click it.
